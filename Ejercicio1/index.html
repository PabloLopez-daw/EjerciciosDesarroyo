                    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                    <h3>From L’Hospitalet to the World — Morad’s Origins</h3>
                    <p>Morad El Khattouti El Horami, known artistically as Morad, was born in L’Hospitalet de Llobregat (Barcelona) in 1999. Of Moroccan descent and raised in the La Florida neighborhood, Morad grew up in humble surroundings where the streets served as both school and stage. From an early age, he was exposed to the realities of urban life, which later became a powerful influence in his music.</p>
                    <p>Before becoming a recognized figure in the music scene, Morad faced economic and personal challenges that shaped his character. It was precisely this rawness of daily life that gave him a voice and authenticity. He began writing lyrics inspired by his surroundings: friendship, loyalty, his neighborhood, and personal perseverance.</p>
                    <p>His rise to fame began in 2019 with tracks like “Lacoste”, “MDLR”, and “Motorola”, songs that quickly went viral for their honest style and unmistakable flow. His music resonated with thousands of young people who saw their own realities reflected in his raw, unfiltered stories.</p>

                    <h3>The Voice of the Streets — Rise, Impact, and Legacy</h3>
                    <p>As his name grew, Morad established himself as one of the leading figures in Spanish trap and drill, always staying true to his street roots. His lyrics, blending grit and reflection, depict a reality many live but few dare to tell.</p>
                    <p>Morad has collaborated with international artists and has brought his sound beyond Spain, showing that the language of the streets is universal. Songs like “Pelele”, “Se Grita”, and “Lo Noto” have crossed borders, and his authenticity has made him a symbol of resilience and pride for a generation.</p>
                    <p>Beyond music, Morad represents a philosophy: staying true to yourself without forgetting where you come from. His message of loyalty, respect, and hard work inspires young people worldwide. Without abandoning his roots, Morad continues to prove that talent, effort, and heart can take you far.</p>
